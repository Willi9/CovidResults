- COVID-19 Cases in Colorado on March 7, 2021

   On March 7th 2021 there were 435,762 cases in Colorado according to THE COVID TRACKING PROJECT
   The percentage of LatinX of all the cases was 27.36% percentage. This is very interesting because
   according to the 2020 Census 21.6% of the population of Colorado is LatinX. This can mean that Covid-19
   is impacting the LatinX population of Colorado more than other ethnic groups. It is important to look into
   this information further to address this issue.

- Covid-19 Deaths in Colorado on March 7, 2021

    On March 7th, 2021 there were 5,986 deaths attributed to Covid-19. If we look at the percentage of death according
    to racial groups we see that 64.63% of deaths are white, 3.19% are African American, and 20.11% are LatinX.
    There are no big disparities between deaths, and it looks like that deaths are not affecting one racial group over another one.
    It is important that we keep an eye on deaths because the percentage of LatinX deaths should increase to mirror
    the percentages of positive Covid-19 cases..
